# Digital Steganography and Watermarking for Digital Images

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
**Digital Steganography and Watermarking for Digital Images** is a security-focused project designed to protect sensitive information and verify content authenticity.  
It implements techniques to:
- **Steganography** â€“ Conceal secret data within digital images without noticeably altering their visual quality.
- **Watermarking** â€“ Embed invisible or visible marks into images and ensure integrity.

The goal is to provide a secure, efficient, and user-friendly system for hiding and verifying data in images.
